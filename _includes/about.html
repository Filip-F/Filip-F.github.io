      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>Hello, I'm Filip Francetic, a student at the University of Waterloo.</p>

      <p>I enjoy all forms of development, just keep me away from CSS</p>

      <p>I have experience doing various forms of fullstack development, from frontend  <br/>focused JavaScript development to more backend focused development</p>
